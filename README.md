# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Functions
	- Functions are basically instructions for the computer to do. They can tell the computer to write your name, count by fives, or add some numbers.
	
	* Parameters
	- Parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Some names could be, "x" and "y", "number1" and "number2". This are basically placeholders for values that get passed to them.

	* Arguments
	- Arguments are the real values that are passed to and recieved by the function. These are passed to the parameters.  

	* `if` statements
	-'if' statements will execute a block of code IF something is true. If the statement is false, another code block will execute. They kind of work like this: Your mom might say "If you eat your dinner, you can have some ice cream. If you don't eat your dinner, I will eat the ice cream.""


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.


4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
